# Cmder Mini for PortableApps.com

<img src="App/AppInfo/appicon_128.png" align=left>

[Cmder Mini](https://cmder.net) is a software package created out of pure 
frustration over absence of usable console emulator on Windows. It is based 
on ConEmu with major config overhaul, comes with a Monokai color scheme, 
amazing clink (further enhanced by clink-completions) and a custom prompt layout.

The main advantage of Cmder is portability. It is designed to be totally 
self-contained with no external dependencies, which makes it great for USB 
Sticks or cloud storage. So you can carry your console, aliases and binaries 
(like wget, curl and git) with you anywhere.

## Runtime dependencies
* 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows Vista or greater.

### Install outside of the PortableApps.com Platform

is a bit involved.
